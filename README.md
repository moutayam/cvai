# Welcome Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Webinar!
This repository contains the "Task" file, the file itself is a Jupyter Notebook exported from Google Colab.

## What to do with file content?
Feel free to open the file in your own Google Colab. The task is to change some hyperparamters of the neural network and to play with adding/removing/changing some layers in the original LeNet5 implementation, we are not about getting 100% accuracy classifying MNIST numbers, we are after touching the beauty of artificial intelligence and the feasibility of learning it nowadays, so have fun!

P.S. you can't save your changes in this Notebook directly, so please save a copy of it in your Google Drive when prompted to do so.

## Then what?
After running the Notebook in your Colab and changing the parameters, click "Share" button in the upper right part of Colab, then click "Copy link", after doing that paste the link in a Word file and upload to the following website using "Upload your reports" button:
[Information Systems and Technologies (tsu.ru)](https://fit.tsu.ru/robotics/)

In the new page you need to fill up your information, and don't forget to choose "Practical Task 2 "Using the neural networks ..."
# One last thing..
We will publish the code and data for drone hunting system here :3
Feel free to star this repo and follow me on Github!
